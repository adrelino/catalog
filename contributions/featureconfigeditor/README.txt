FeatureConfigEditor
===================

A tool designed to help developers create configurations for browser-specific builds of qooxdoo applications. Detected feature sets from multiple clients can be imported and compared to find common values. The selected features are displayed in JSON format and can be pasted straight into the application's config.json.
